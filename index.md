This blog includes an internship summary in Handshakes as a Machine Learning Intern. 
I was involved in 3 projects during my time there, and I will talk more about these projects below. 

3 Machine Learning Projects: 
  1. Basic Image Classification using Pytorch/ Pytorch Lightning
  2. Reimplement Tablenet Paper using Pytorch Lightning
  3. Image Table Extraction using Table Transformer Model
